# OpenAI React Chat Web Application

This project provides a web frontend for the OpenAI chat API. This project is for developers or advanced users that are familiar with [OpenAI Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/) but want to customize the web interface.

## Goals
* Provide the same features as [OpenAI Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).
* Use a modern web stack of React, Tailwind CSS, and Typescript.
